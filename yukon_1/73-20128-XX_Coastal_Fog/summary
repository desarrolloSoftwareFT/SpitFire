                      ASSIGNMENT REPORT FOR ALL BOARDS
 
     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 3.417.
            The standard deviation is 3.925.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 4327 interface pins for 2741 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.633.
ires are being generated for this node. 
Check the fixture file, the old wirelist, and the test sources to make sure 
that the node names are correct.  Make sure that the appropriate .r files 
exist. (WARNING MPA404)

Node SFP_MOD_ABS_FPGA<2> on board Coastal_Fog_73-20128-04 is in the fixture file 
fixture/fixture.o.  However, it is not in any requirements file, and it 
is not in the old wirelist.  No wires are being generated for this node. 
Check the fixture file, the old wirelist, and the test sources to make sure 
that the node names are correct.  Make sure that the appropriate .r files 
exist. (WARNING MPA404)

The fixture has been modified.  Module Pin Assignment has added
new Agilent TestJet Mux/Port assignments for additional TestJet
probes.  Check the "fixture/testjet_mux" file for the new wires.
New TestJet wiring changes have been added to the end of the
existing MUX/port wiring addresses; no difference report has
been generated.
